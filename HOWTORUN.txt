HOW TO RUN
----------
The Universal Credit System was written as shell script on a Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian.

Make sure you have the following programs installed before running the UCS Client:

bc		(used for floating point calculations)
openssl		(used for TSA verification)
gpg		(aka GnuPG, used for signing)
dialog		(used for GUI)

Install >bc< by executing the following command:
sudo apt-get install bc

Install >gpg< by executing the following command:
sudo apt-get install gnupg2

Install >openssl< by executing the following command:
sudo apt-get install openssl

Install >dialog< by executing the following command:
sudo apt-get install dialog

Once you have installed all these programs, you have to execute the install.sh script that created required folders:
./install.sh

Now you can run the UCS Client just like you would executed any other script:
./ucs_client.sh
